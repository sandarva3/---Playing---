### ER and Relational Model.

- Entity:
        Entity is any type of real world object which has properties(attributes).

- Entity Relationship Model (ER Model):
        ER Model is the high level conceptual view of database. It layouts the different entities in database and how they are connected, 
        without revealing much details about them. It's a tool to facilitate a communication between application programmer, designer, and end user.

- Data Model:
        It's a structure which defines a database object(an entity), its relationship and constraint in database. It's a blueprint for how a data is stored in dbms.
        3 levels of data modelling:
            1) Conceptual Data Modelling: It includes very high level design of data, only containing its relationship with other entities. It doesn't include object's attributes
                    and primary key.
            2) Logical Data Modelling: It includes the relationship among entities, and their attributes. It also contains primary and foregin keys. But it doesn't contain
                    physical implementation or specefic dbms.
            3) Physical Data Modelling: It shows how the model will be actually implemented in dbms. It shows the data types, contraints, column names, primary and foreign keys,
                    and relationship between entities(tables).

- Attributes: They are properties of an entity.
    1)Simple attributes: attributes which can't be divided further. name, age.
    2)Composite attributes: attributes which can be divided further. Full name to first and last name.
    3)Derived attributes: which can be derived from other attributes. age can be derived from DOB.
    4)Single valued: which can have only 1 value. citizenship no.
    5)Multi valued: which can have multiple values. phone no, email.

- ER diagram: It's the graphical representation of database design, to visualize the different entities, their attributes, and relationship between them. It's the blueprint for
	actual implementation of database design.
	Components:
		1)Rectangle: To represent entity.
		2)Ellipse/Oval: To represent entity's attributes
		3)Diamonds: To represent relationship between different entities.
		4)Line: To link entities and their attributes.
		5)Double Ellipse: To represent multi-valued attributes.
		6)Dashed Ellipse: To represent derived attributes.
		7)Double Rectangle: To represent weak entity.
	
	The role of an entity in ER model describes the function or part it plays in relationship. The purpose of role is to make model more clear to avoid confusion.
	
	Mapping cardinalities describes the association between entities of set A and entities of set B, and how they interact. It defines the constraint in relationship between
		entities of different set.
		Its types are:
			1)One-One: A instance of entity A is only associated with a single instance of entity B.(1 person have only 1 passport)
			2)One-Many: An instance of entity A is associated with many instances entity B, but an instance in entity B is only associated with single instance
				of entity A.(A teacher teaches many students, but any one student is only taught by a single teacher)
			3)Many-One: Multiple instances of entity A is associated with only single instance of entity B, but an instance of B is associated with only single
				instance of A.
			4)Many-Many: Many instances of A can be associated with many instances of B, and vice versa.(Students take many courses, and each course have many students).
