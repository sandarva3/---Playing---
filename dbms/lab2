- Alter the column name of table: ALTER TABLE table_name CHANGE old_column_name new_column_name column_type;
	eg: ALTER TABLE users CHANGE address location VARCHAR(255);


- Change the value of particular record of user: 
	eg: UPDATE employee SET name="Krishna", address="Pharping" WHERE eid = 1;

- To get the records from a table where each record have a distict value.
	SELECT * FROM employee GROUP BY job HAVING COUNT(job) = 1; // only records of employee whose job is truly unique(meaning any other person except them isn't
								   // doing the job.
	or, 
	SELECT name FROM employee GROUP BY job; // gives the name of employees having distinct jobs. each employee here will have distict jobs. if multiple employees 
						// were having same jobs, then the it'll show the employee appearing first in the record.

- To delete records of employees whose job is 'ceo' or 'CEO':
	DELETE FROM employee WHERE job = "ceo";
	// To delete employees whose job is 'administrator' and have salary greater than 35000:
	DELETE FROM employee WHERE job = "administrator" AND salary > 35000;


- NOTE: If the specified column was of type int and we try to insert varchar value into it then 0 would be inserted automatically by system.
