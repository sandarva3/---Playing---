Components of JDBC:
- Driver manager: 
	- Responsible for connecting database with java application.
	- Manages list of available drivers.
	- Factory of connection objects.
	- Part of java.sql package.
	-methods: 
		- public static Driver getDriver(String url) throws SQLException{} // returns the driver associated with given url
		- public static Connection getConnection(String url, String uname, String pwd) throws SQLException{} // used to connect with db, returns connection object

- Connection:
	- An interface, which represents session between java application and database.
	- Factory of Statement and PreparedStatement objects.
	- methods:
		public PreparedStatement prepareStatement(String query) throws SQL Exception{} // makes PreparedStatement object for dynamic querying
		public void close() throws SQLException {} // It closes connection with database and return all jdbc resources immediately.

- Statement:
	- An interface that allows us to execute sql queries.
	- doesn't have placeholder for dynamic querying
	- methods:
		public ResultSet executeQuery(String query) throws SQLException {} // allows us to execute DQL select statement, returns ResultSet object
		public int executeUpdate(String query) throws SQLException {} // allows us to execute DML commands like update,insert,delete, it returns int.

- PreparedStatment:
	- A sub-interface of statement.
	- Allows us to execute dynamic query through placeholder.
	- methods: (same as of Statement above)

- ResultSet:
	- An interface whose object is created when DQL command is executed.
	- It holds tabular data(table) and maintains a cursor at the row.
	- methods:
		- public boolean next() {} // moves cursor one step down from current position
		- public boolean previous() {} // moves cursor one step up from current position
		- public boolean first() {} // moves cursor to first row
		- public boolean last() {} // moves cursor to last row

- Rowset:
	- Extended version of ResultSet.
	- It's more easier, flexible than ResultSet.
