- Security means the protection of data in database, either form unauthenticated users, or from authenticated users.
- The objective of achieving secure system is for: integrity of data, secrecy of data, and availability of data.
- And database security means securing access to data from different users, giving permission to do various operations on data to certain users, while preventing others.

Generally Database security can be: 
	1) Physical security(the database server must be physically secure from theft or intruders, it should be kept in protected site).
	2) Logical security: Have the logical mechanism to verify user, identify user, allow for different level of permissions for different users.
	
Security levels:
	1) Physical security
	2) DBMS security
	3) OS security
	4) Network security
	5) Human verification: who are allowed for dbms access.
	
	
- Authorization: It refers to the mechanism of authorizing authenticated users to perform certain operations, basically checking and making sure that users can only do operations they
	are permitted to do.
	- It can include:
	1) authorization to read data
	2) to write data
	3) modify/update data
	4) delete data

- The highest authority is given to DBA(Database Administrator).

#Grant Commands
Syntax: Grant privileges on <database>.<table> to '<user>' @ '<host>';
Grant select on tesla.customers to 'sandarva' @ '%'; -- '%' means every host.
Grant inser,update,delete on mydb.* to 'sandarva' @ 'localhost';

#Revoke Commands
Syntax: Revoke privileges on <database>.<table> from '<user>' @ '<host>';

--View what privileges does user have
show grants for '<user>' @ '<host>';

--Remove user
Drop user '<user>' @ '<host>'; -- use '%' on host to remove user from every host.


- Role: A role is a mechanism to manage privileges to users more efficiently. Here we create role, and add required privileges to it, and assign role to user, giving them all those
	privileges. Instead of providing privileges 1 by 1 to each user, it lets use make a set of privileges and assign it to user.
	#Role commands
	create role teacher;
	grant insert,select on mydb to teacher; -- grant privileges to role
	grant teacher to 'teacher1' @ '%'; -- assign 'teacher1' user a teacher role
	revoke teacher from 'teacher1' @ '%';
	drop role teacher; -- remove the role entirely
