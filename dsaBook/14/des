- Memory in computers are just cells, where each cell represents a bit.

- Array requires a contigious block cells to store data, which becomes more difficult as the amount of data increases in an array.

- The main strength of LinkedList compared to array is that: data can be dispersed throughout the memory, meaning linkedlist won't require a contigious block of memory
		to store data.

- LinkedList: It's a user-defined data type where it's variable(generally called as 'node') can store two things: data and address of next variable of this same type.
		It contains two parts: data, and link(the address part). Multiple instances of these LinkedList are created, and one is linked to another.
		The starting node of linkedlist is generally referred to as Head, while last node in the list is generally called Tail.
